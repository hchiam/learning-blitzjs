BlitzJS is a [_**full-stack**_](https://blitzjs.com/docs/why-blitz) "meta meta framework" with some common functionalities already figured out for you (instead of bare-bones), like routing, APIs, project structure, and user signup/login/authentication/reset:

Framework --> Meta Framework --> **Meta Meta Framework**

React --> Next --> **Blitz**

## Install once globally on your computer

```sh
yarn global add blitz
```

(Or `npm install -g blitz --legacy-peer-deps`)

I had to update my Node.js version to get the `yarn` command to work: https://github.com/hchiam/learning-nodejs

## Set up a new project to run on http://localhost:3000

```sh
blitz new blitz-example-project
cd blitz-example-project
blitz dev
# http://localhost:3000
```

## Getting node version warnings?

```sh
nvm install v16.13.1; node --version
```
